# Research

Session insights, architecture decisions, and blog-ready seeds. Each file captures the thinking behind a decision or exploration — the "why" that doesn't belong in code comments or the backlog.

## Naming

`<topic>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` for dated sessions, `<topic>.md` for evolving documents.

## What goes here

- Multi-model council sessions and their conclusions
- Architecture explorations (AI layer design, personal data integration)
- Pipeline experiments and what we learned
- Narrative drafts that could become blog posts

## What doesn't go here

- Task tracking → `BACKLOG.md`
- Resolved yes/no decisions → `_dev/resolved-decisions.md`
- API docs or technical reference → `docs/`
