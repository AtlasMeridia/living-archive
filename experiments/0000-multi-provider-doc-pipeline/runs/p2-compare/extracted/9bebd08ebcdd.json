Explanation: Arbitration is  a private dispute resolution process i n which Parties ( b y themselves o r through their attorneys) submitdisputes t o a neutral arbitrator who is  charged w i t h rendering a f a i r and impartial decision as t o all  issues presented. Whenarbitration is  selected, the Parties give u p their rights t o trial b y judge o r j u r y and t o full  and formal court process. Basic discoveryrights ( e . g . , depositions, document production) are provided f o r under California l a w . Rules o f evidence and procedure are lessrigid than i n trial court. Arbitration fees are typically o n a n hourly basis. The decision o f the arbitrator i s ﬁnal and binding o n allParties to the arbitration agreement (Paragraph 7 B ) . The arbitrator can award compensatory damages, punitive damages, and/o r order speciﬁc performance, injunctive relief and declaratory relief. N o trial o r other court process is  available t o re-try thecase o r t o appeal the merits o f the arbitrator's ruling. This  means that even when a party claims the arbitrator made a clearly\nw r o n g decision, based o n a misunderstanding o f fact  o r o f law  o r a n unwillingness t o follow  the  l a w , that  decision neverthelessremains ﬁnal and unappealable. Only i n cases o f actual fraud i n the arbitration process, corruption, bias, lack o f due process orjurisdiction, o r arbitrator's computation error, can an award be  vacated o r modiﬁed. The Parties are advised to confer with legalcounsel for advice before committing to binding arbitration.\nB .

The  arbitratorshall be a retired Superior Court judge o r a licensed California attorney with at  least ﬁ v e years real estate experience. I f the Parties\ncannot agree o n a n arbitrator , the  S u p e r i o r C o u r t shall  appoint the  a r b i t r a t o r . The  ﬁ l i n g o f a n a c t i o n i n a court  o f competent jurisdiction\nt o enable the  recording o f a notice o f pending a c t i o n , f o r o r d e r o f attachment, receivership, injunction, o r o t h e r provisional remediesshall  not constitute a waiver o f the right t o mediation o r arbitration under this Contract, regardless o f whether the said complaintincludes causes o f action not  necessary t o the recordation o f the notice  o f pending a c t i o n .
