We  understand that you are facing sudden changes i n your life due\nto t h e d e a t h of o u r f a t h e r. Having no verbal  or w r i t t e n indication from  o u r f a t h e r that  he  made\nthose promises, we cannot agree that all of the items requested be paid for from the estate.\nHowever, i n good faith and t o help y o u with your transition, we  would like  t o extend some\nadditional funds t o you.\n1 ) We  understand that o u r father was i n progress o f transferring $50,000 to an IRA  o f which you\nare the beneﬁciary. We  believe these funds should rightfully be yours. Due  to this and to\naddress y o u r concerns, we  are willing to transfer the two largest IRA  accounts, o f which we  are\nthe sole beneﬁciaries, to you. This  would be the Vanguard I R A , currently valued at\napproximately $45,000, and the Scottrade I R A , currently valued at approximately $43,000.\n2 ) We  agree f o r you to keep the ring with the  marquis diamond that was  previously our\nmother's. O u r father gave this ring to you o f his volition during his lifetime. We  don't believe\nthe gift should have had \"strings attached\" a n d understand that it  has sentimental value f o r you.\n3 ) I n exchange, we  request that the promissory note o f $380K  be  rewritten t o o u r names, rather\nthan distribute this asset i n probate court. As  the beneﬁciaries o f the note  are  not  i n dispute,\nsigning a new promissory note is  a more expedient way to transfer the asset.\n4) We do not agree for additional funds to be allocated for health insurance o r a car . We believe\nthat our father left you the funds that he did to cover this type o f expense, and the additional\nIRA  funds we  have offered can also be used f o r this expense.\n5 ) We  d o not agree f o r you to be the listing agent f o r the family home. As  discussed previously\nwith M r . Froehlich, we  agree for you to reside at the house for 6 months, until December 31,\n2010, at  which point we  would like t o prepare the house f o r sale ourselves a n d work with arealtor of our choosing.\nPlease u n d e r s t a n d that we  have  concerns about the requests made and that this proposal\nrepresents a compromise.

A f t e r disclosing that  information t o y o u , we  n e e d t o obtain the  informed written\nconsent  t o o u r joint  representation o f e a c h o f o u r clients  i n this  m a t t e r . A s n o t e d a b o v e , jointrepresentation has advantages and disadvantages. It  can provide economic a n d tactical\nadvantages. F o r example, joint representation i s obviously less expensive than i f each client\nr e t a i n e d separate  counsel, a n d it  is  t y p i c a l l y more  efﬁcient  t o have  one  counsel  r a t h e r thanmultiple  counsel involved. A l s o , i n situations like  this, parties o n one  side  o f a matter often\nﬁ n d it  advantageous t o present a \"united front\" t o the  other side.\nO n the downside, whenever lawyers represent a group o f clients i n a matter, it  is\npossible that  the  l a w y e r s might  emphasize  the  interests o f the  g r o u p o v e r the  individual clients'\nrespective interests o r might  f a v o r the  interests o f some  o f t h e individual clients over those of\nthe  others, despite the  lawyers' best  efforts not  t o d o so.\nA n o t h e r point  you s h o u l d be  aware  o f i n d e c i d i n g w h e t h e r t o agree  t o the  jointrepresentation is  that  all  o f y o u r communications w i t h TLH&M  about t h e Representation will\nbe  privileged w i t h regard t o the  outside w o r l d , but  t h e y will  not  be  privileged vis-a-vis each\no t h e r . I n other words, unless the  other clients agree, y o u cannot tell us  something about this\nm a t t e r a n d a s k us  t o k e e p it  secret from  o u r o t h e r client i n this  same  m a t t e r . As  l o n g as  we\n305970\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nAugust 1 6 , 2011\nPage 3\nrepresent e a c h o f y o u i n this matter, there will  be  n o privilege shielding o u r discussions with\nyou about the Representation from the other clients we are representing i n this matter.\nLikewise, i f a n y o f o u r clients i n this matter were t o sue each other i n connection with this\nmatter, then the law would not allow any of you t o invoke the privilege against the others as to\nany information which was disclosed t o TLH&M  about this matter while TLH&M was  jointly\nrepresenting y o u each o n this  m a t t e r . Indeed, i f s u c h a lawsuit arose, we  might  be  required,\nunder s e c t i o n 9 6 2 o f the  California Evidence  C o d e , t o divulge s u c h information i n that\nlitigation between you.\nAll  this does  not  m e a n that w e will  always tell e a c h client e a c h detail about  this matter.\nWe  a r e o b l i g a t e d t o k e e p o u r clients  i n f o r m e d o f signiﬁcant  d e v e l o p m e n t s , but  c a n a n d will  use\no u r discretion a n d professional judgment about  what  information t o pass  on.\nActual a n d Potential conﬂicts\nAt  present, w e see  n o actual conﬂicts o f interest between Karen a n d K e n n y i n any\ncapacity .
