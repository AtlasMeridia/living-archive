All,\nI agree.\nI discovered that a lot  o f program testers just arbitrarily change inputs (sets, trunks, etc.) without changingcorresponding conﬁguration parameters (intra-ofﬁce ratio, etc.), and expect the program t o yield a reasonable result. Iftrafﬁc is  not  balanced, additional sets will  not  cause the number o f Media Cards t o increase, since i f set CCS  has noplace (trunk) t o terminate, it  w i l l just pile u p t o the extra line CCS number and does not g o through the Algorithm tocalculate resource.\nS o , i f the trafﬁc i s signiﬁcantly imbalanced, we  should demand better input data, a warning message is  not enough.\nWe could get b y with a warning message i n Meridian Conﬁgurator because the imbalance will  only impact CPUloading, and it  will  not show unless at  critical point (from within rated capacity to beyond). I n CS1000 systems, theadditional impact i s o n the number o f Media Cards, which either o v e r - o r under-provisioning will  have signiﬁcantperformance and cost impacts.\nI am  glad this  issue is  ﬁ n a l l y settled.\nRegards,\nFeng\n----Original Message-----\nFrom:  O u t r a m , Robert  [BVW:9P40:EXCH]Friday , October 0 8 , 2 0 0 4 4:53 AMDocherty , Robert [BVW :9P60:EXCH]; Y eazel, Irene [EXES:7770:EXCH]; T e o , Ka  [NGD:5011:EXCHJL i u , F e n g [SC101:9T52:EXCH]\nSubject: RE:  R P C 2 9 5 0 - Trafﬁc  alert\nIrene,\nShould be  a hard stop i f i t s that poorly imbalanced and ﬁ x e d before proceeding.\nRob\n----Original  Message----\n1\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nﬁle:///C|/My Documents/good.work.by.louis.htr\nFrom: Lanthier, Louis [BVW:9P20:EXCH]\nSent: Tuesday , August 2 1 , 2 0 0 1 1 1 : 1 5 AMTo:  Liu, F e n g [SC9:9P22:EXCH]\nSubject: RE:  CallPilot/SCCS channel limit i nfo req'd & testing recommendationsGood work Feng!
