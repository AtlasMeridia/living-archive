# Living Archive — Project Brief

**Project Name:** Living Archive  
**Project Owner:** Kenny Liu / ATLAS Meridia LLC  
**Last Updated:** January 11, 2026  
**Status:** Reframing in progress

---

## What This Is

Living Archive is a content project and methodology for organizing your digital and physical life — accounts, media, documents, relationships, stories — in a way that's useful to you now and transferable later.

It's not software. It's:
- A blog documenting approaches and tools
- A public GitHub repo with templates and prompts for AI-assisted organization
- Curated resources (services, tools, workflows)
- A personal case study (the Liu family archive) that demonstrates the approach

---

## The Problem

People accumulate:
- Thousands of photos across devices and cloud services
- Hundreds of online accounts with no documentation
- Physical documents with no digital backup
- Family knowledge that exists only in elders' memories
- No clear plan for what happens to any of it

The "green box" concept from estate planning — an organized collection of documents and instructions for survivors — doesn't scale to digital life. And preparing for death feels morbid, so people procrastinate indefinitely.

**Reframe:** This isn't about preparing to die. It's about knowing where everything is. The person who has their digital life organized is incidentally prepared for incapacity or death.

---

## The Approach

AI changes the equation. An agent that understands your digital footprint can help with:
- Inventorying accounts and assets
- Organizing and tagging photos
- Extracting information from documents
- Creating structured records from unstructured notes
- Maintaining the system over time

Living Archive documents how to use AI as the organizing tool, which stays relevant as the AI improves. We're not building software that gets eaten by AI progress — we're documenting the methodology.

## Project Components

### 1. Blog Content (kennyliu.io/notes, tagged living-archive)

Posts documenting:
- The overall philosophy and approach
- Specific workflows (photo digitization, account inventory, etc.)
- Tool reviews and comparisons
- Progress on the personal case study
- Interviews or guest perspectives

**Platform:** Ghost blog at kennyliu.io/notes

### 2. GitHub Repository (public)

- Methodology documentation
- Prompt templates for common tasks
- Schema examples for organizing different content types
- Checklists and guides
- This project brief and related planning docs

**Repository:** github.com/AtlasMeridia/living-archive (rename from every-branch-archive)

### 3. Personal Case Study: Liu Family Archive

The ongoing work of digitizing and organizing the Liu family history serves as:
- Content engine (real problems, real solutions to write about)
- Proof of concept for the methodology
- Personal motivation to keep the project moving

This includes:
- Photo digitization (~50% complete)
- Genealogy work (adding women to patrilineal record)
- Red book integration (April 2026)
- Elder interviews

The personal archive work is documented in `/docs/liu-family-archive/` within this repo.

## What This Is Not

- **Not a SaaS product** — no hosted service, no user accounts
- **Not a software tool** — no app to download or install
- **Not a startup** — developed under ATLAS Meridia for potential expense coverage, but not a venture-scale business
- **Not prescriptive** — methodology adapts to different tools and workflows

---

## Audience

Primary: Individuals organizing their own digital lives

Secondary (future):
- Families dealing with a deceased relative's digital estate
- People helping aging parents get organized
- Estate planners and professionals

## Relationship to Other Projects

| Project | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| **Hinterland Atlas** | Living Archive may become a vertical within HA. Both involve documentation, memory, place. |
| **ATLAS Meridia** | Living Archive is developed under ATLASM for business/expense purposes |
| **10 AI Layer / AEON** | Separate projects — both use AI for organization but different domains |

## Near-Term Actions

### Repository Setup
- [ ] Rename repo from `every-branch-archive` to `living-archive`
- [ ] Update this brief and remove/archive obsolete docs
- [ ] Create `/docs/liu-family-archive/` for personal case study docs
- [ ] Make repo public
- [ ] Add README appropriate for public audience

### Site Setup
- [ ] Create `living-archive` tag in Ghost
- [ ] Add `/living-archive` route to Next.js site
- [ ] Design section header/layout (can match main site initially)
- [ ] Draft first post (could be: "What is Living Archive?" or "I'm digitizing 50 years of family photos")

### Content Planning
- [ ] Outline first 3-5 posts
- [ ] Identify which parts of existing implementation plan become blog content vs. repo docs

---

## Open Questions

1. **First post angle:** Philosophy/manifesto piece, or dive straight into a practical workflow?

2. **Repo structure:** What goes in the public repo vs. stays private? The Liu family specifics should probably stay private.

3. **Visual identity:** Logo, imagery direction? (Vine-covered box concept was mentioned)

4. **Content cadence:** How often to publish? Tied to actual progress on personal archive, or independent?

---

## Success Criteria

**Minimum:**
- Public repo with useful templates/prompts
- 5+ published posts documenting the approach
- At least one external person finds it useful

**Aspirational:**
- Recognized resource in the "digital estate" / "digital organization" space
- Community contributions to the methodology
- Revenue covers hosting/domain costs
