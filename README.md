# Living Archive

A methodology for organizing your digital and physical life — accounts, media, documents, relationships, stories — in a way that's useful now and transferable later.

## What This Is

Living Archive is not software. It's:

- **Documentation** of approaches and workflows for digital life organization
- **Templates and prompts** for AI-assisted organization tasks
- **Curated resources** — tools, services, and references
- **A case study** demonstrating the approach through a real family archive project

## The Problem

People accumulate thousands of photos, hundreds of accounts, and decades of documents with no plan for organizing or transferring any of it. The "green box" concept from estate planning doesn't scale to digital life.

**The reframe:** This is less about preparing to die and more about knowing, clarity and optimization. Organization now, transferability as a side effect.

## The Approach

AI changes what's possible. An agent can help inventory accounts, tag photos, extract information from documents, and maintain systems over time. Living Archive documents how to use AI as the organizing tool — methodology that stays relevant as the AI improves.
